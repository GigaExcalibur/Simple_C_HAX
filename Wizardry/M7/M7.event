// Helper functions and procs for creating "mode 7" style effects within GBAFE.
// Based the amazing GBA M7 demos and guides featured in tonc (https://www.coranac.com/tonc/text/)
// hack by Stan

/*
 * NOTE ABOUT USED RAM AREA
 * 
 * This hack makes use of the "free" IWRAM area located at 03003750.
 * 
 * Why is it "free"? Well, this area is normally part of where ARM functions are being copied to at startup,
 * but only a few of those copies are actually managed and called by the engine.
 * The other functions are not unused tho, but it's the *original* ROM functions that are called instead.
 * 
 * The source area starts at 08000228, but the first relevant copied function starts at 08000490 (it's PushToHiOAM).
 * This means that we have 08000490 - 08000228 = 0x268 (616) bytes to play with starting at 03003750!

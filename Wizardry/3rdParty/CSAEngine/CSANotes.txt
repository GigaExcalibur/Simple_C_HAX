0203FF34 is multiple things:
	+ 00 is some "dummy" frame data
	+ 10 is also some "dummy" frame data
	+ 20 is some "dummy" oam data
	+ 2C is an AIS
	+ 74 is also an AIS
0203FFFC is "FRAME_DATA_STREAM_PTR"

If those AIS are getting linked into the array no wonder CSAs breaks with things that re-sort it
(like, say, for example: front dodges)

CSA table entry:
	+ 00 is frame data
	+ 04 is right-to-left foreground
	+ 08 is left-to-right foreground
	+ 0C is right-to-left background
	+ 10 is left-to-right background
